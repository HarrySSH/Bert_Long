Mrs. ***** said in that case her sister would want to have the same team back for her care. I asked whether she wanted to discuss it over and she said no her sister would agree. I explained that she could not have services just for the person who ***** her. She understood. She said because her sister feels so bad she does not like to exert herself of talk much and therefore is sometimes bothered by questions and conversation.     I requested that she assist when the nurse visits in case her sister doesn't understand why she asks questions and grows impatient.  She said that her sister is having a lot more pain but doesn't like to take medicine. I explained that she may need to assist the nurse when she explains the reason for questions and the reason for using medication a certain way she recommends. Mrs. ***** agreed that sometimes her sister doesn't understand and grows impatient. She doesn't like to talk about her illness.    I will notify ***** *****, RN that they would like another referral to home heath and preferably get the same team. She thanked me for assistance and caring the medical team has provided. She explained that she is at home taking care of her husband with stage IV lung cancer. She has another sister who helps Mrs. ***** but that she is the main organizer.

I provided information about home health services requiring a skilled need and that they could not continue services if her sister only wanted the home health aid who bathed her. I asked about her ***** chore-provider assisting with bathing and we reviewed the number of hours Mrs. ***** is getting from *****. She was reevaluated up to 263 hours of assistance. Her chore-provider stays overnight sometimes.    I explained that I would speak with her doctor to see if they wish to make a new referral for home health services and whether there are other skilled needs besides PT. Her sister states there are mouth sores from which she is suffering. I explained that might not be considered a skilled need. I asked if her sister would be willing to consider using pain medication so that she could work with the PT.

D4894CDE7CCDB4	"New patient. Contacted me privately and recommended she come to *****. She is 48 years old and post double mastectomy a year ago. Diagnosed at 47 pre-menopausal with Grade 1 ***** cancer. But her tissue showed extensive DCIS and LCIS. She opted for double mastectomy and abdominal flap reconstruction which she got in ***** *****. She has a 5 year old daughter who she had when she was 43. She lives with a  Domestic partner but is not married. This is a long term relationship.  This is a very self-aware woman who had one very good long term therapy with a therapist no longer in practice. With this person ***** was able to access and express her anger which she has held since a child. She grew up with a Lebanese Dad and July 14 Italian Mom who both were extremely volatile.Her home was violent and explosive. Her father had an affair and left her mother with three small children. She cut off from her father for 13 years but has been back in touch recently. She says he is still not a good man.    She became an angry and moody ***** with no help for how to manage her emotions. As an adult she still struggles with angry outbursts and a worried temperament. She got clear about the relative importance of minor worries in the face of her cancer diagnosis, but that bigger perspective has been lost. Now she has ongoing fears about her cancer recurring. She says she lived the ***** lifestyle of any of her friends. This was a shock to her.   While it sounds like she did a very conscious job of letting her daughter know what was happening without using the word cancer, her daughter has been more angry and volatile lately. This in turn triggers *****'s own reactive ness. She feels terribly. She isn't abusive but in the face of her daughter's anger, gets angry back. She is concerned by this dynamic and wants to help both of them learn to better handle their anger. As we ""[STOP]Had a great time visiting the east coast. Saw friends and family and stayed with people. Very social and fun. But she also compared herself to her friends who all seemed to "" have it together"". She feels her life is a *****. She doesn't own a home and she made other choices early in life to travel and not safe and now feels she's paying the costs. She resents her life which is dedicated to caring for herself so her cancer doesn't not return. Her friends can't understand why she is so strict about her food. She feels different and that there is something wrong with her.  We look at this belief. She feels she constantly has to work on herself to be a half way decent person and she resents the time and effort it takes. She also complains about the time and effort it takes to eat properly and take her supplements and exercise. These activities do not give *****. Then she's angry at herself for not doing them, for example when she takes off from exercise. She feels like she's lost a sense of how to have ***** in her life. And all the efforts to improve herself just add more pressure.  But she also can't let go of those efforts. She's in a very tight position where she won't allow herself to let go and relax a little. She is also under increasing financial pressure as her husband's work is not offering much support. So she feels she has to live this very tight life, just like she did growing up. This is a repeat.  We explore gentle ways to ease up and just allow herself to be without attacking herself. It was very hard. Her judgment on herself for feeling the way she does compounds the problem. We try some self-compassion work but today she says she can't do it.  This sense that there is something wrong with her goes deep and we'll address this more in future sessions.  ""[STOP]She had a good few weeks in many respects but still suffers mentally in ways that are hard for her to come to terms with. She lives with a lot of regret and one the of the biggest is that she was not able to provide a sibling for her daughter. She went on ***** ***** ***** with friends and their children. She saw other families that had multiple kids and saw how good it was for them for have a sibling. Her daughter sleeps with them and says she's lonely on her own, Mom and Dad have each other. This pulls on ***** because she feels so guilty for not being able to have another child. She wishes she had been younger when she started to have children and that she had 2 before her cancer struck. She finds it hard not to dwell on the regrets and her sense of ""victimization"", ""why me"". She resents so much of what her life had been and how hard she needs to work in order to be a better person. There's always this subtle subtext in her brain telling her it should be better, she should be better, life should not be the way it is.  She also struggles with the result of her breast reconstruction. She feels she has to ***** her body from other's view. And she has trouble with sex which is painful. Encourage her to talk to her doctor about that.   ***** did look at a Compassion book and found a format that was very successful one time. ""Soften, allow, *****"" She applied this when reacting to her daughter's demands and it worked really well. She inquired into her reaction and was able to move into a different state ***** mind. But she's hard on herself for not reading more of the book and practicing more. There's a relentlessness of demand to improve and then a despair that she's still where she is though she knows she better than in her past.This is her work.  """	No target therapy implemented
