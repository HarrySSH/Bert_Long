Although pt was previously covered by Medi-Cal, pt was told by a Medi-Cal representative in December 2015 that her income ***** her from renewing her Medi-Cal coverage, thus hindering her upcoming treatment.     Assessment: SW called pt to conduct a brief financial assessment. Pt requested to place SW on ***** so that her friend ***** could hear the information, as well. Pt gave verbal permission for SW to discuss pt's needs and resources in *****'s presence.    Pt has breast cancer diagnosis, lives in ***** ***** of two with her 5 y/o daughter, earns $2,600/mo, and is a CA resident. Based on this assessment, pt appears eligible for ***** coverage. With pt's pending lack of insurance, it seems likely that pt would qualify for federal *****. Pt subsequently came to clinic in order to complete the ***** enrollment process with SW. Possibly because of pt's terminating status with Medi-Cal (she must submit income verification to Medi-Cal by 02/22/16), pt did not immediately qualify for provisional ***** coverage while ***** reviews her application. SW provided pt with a copy of her application, explained the processing timeline to pt, and assessed for any additional needs.     Pt denied needing additional support at this time. She reported having a strong support system which helps her with childcare, covering sudden medical costs when needed, and with her emotional well-being. Pt reported that since she was diagnosed less than a month ago it is all still just settling in for her.
